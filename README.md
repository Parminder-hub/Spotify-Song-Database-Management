# üé∂ Spotify Song Database Management

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to create and manage a simulated **Spotify Song Library** using SQL. The database includes essential information about users, songs, playlists, and song play history. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to create complex SQL databases, perform insightful queries, and analyze song and user data for various use cases.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

1. **Users Table**: Stores user information.
2. **Songs Table**: Stores information about songs.
3. **Playlists Table**: Stores playlists created by users.
4. **Playlist_Songs Table**: Stores the relationship between playlists and songs.
5. **User_Song_Play_History Table**: Tracks user listening history for song analysis.
